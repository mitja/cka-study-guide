 * [ ] Work through relevant documentation and resources according to the [knowledge domains and competencies](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/).
 * [ ] Attend the [Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/) course
 * [ ] Exercise with labs, test exams, and flash cards
